When sniffing some wireless network traffic, it is possible to capture a wireless 4-way handshake.
The 4-way handshake is done by the client and access point (AP) to prove to one another that they know the pre-shared key (PSK).

Using the aircrack-ng wpa2 handshake packet capture, attempt to decipher the pre-shared key used to authenticate to the access point.

Note: The name of the pcap is wpa2.eapol.pcap.
